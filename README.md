# The Steering Behaviors Algorithms
The implementation of **steering behaviours algorithms** using **HTML5** with **Phaser framewok**. These algorithms allow autonomous characters to move in a realistic manner. They will be presented and explained through a series of tutorials with examples.

The source codes of all examples are fully commented so you should be able to follow them quite easy.

## Part 1: The Seek
**The Seek** steering behaviour algorithm allows a vehicle (seeker) to moves toward a target.

Here is the list of files for running the Seek example:
- **steer_01_seek.js**
- **steer_01_seek.html**
- **phaser.min.js**
